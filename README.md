## Purpose

Local Reports is a comprehensive platform designed to address the emotional distress experienced by families and friends when their loved ones go missing. Our goal is to provide a centralized space where both law enforcement agencies and concerned individuals can efficiently report missing youths. By facilitating easy access to reporting mechanisms and leveraging community engagement through monetary incentives, we aim to enhance the search efforts for missing individuals. Additionally, we integrated artificial intelligence to improve user interaction, allowing seamless communication in users' preferred languages.

## Tech Stack and Tools Utilized

### Frontend
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** Standard technologies for building user interfaces.
- **React:** A powerful JavaScript library for building interactive UI components.

### Backend
- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime for building scalable server-side applications.
- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database for storing flexible, schema-less data.
- **TypeScript:** A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, providing enhanced code quality and maintainability.

### Artificial Intelligence
- **Cloudflare:** Leveraged for implementing AI features to facilitate user interaction.

### Notification
- **Twilio:** Integrated for sending notifications to users, enhancing communication effectiveness.

### APIs
- **Google Maps API:** Integrated to provide mapping functionalities, enhancing the visualization of reported incidents.

## How We Built It

Local Reports was developed as a full-stack web application. We began by designing a user-friendly frontend interface using HTML/CSS/JavaScript and React. The backend was built using Node.js, MongoDB, and TypeScript, ensuring efficient data management and processing. Integration of the Google Maps API presented a significant challenge, particularly in synchronizing it with our React frontend. Additionally, implementing artificial intelligence features required careful planning and integration with Cloudflare's services. Throughout the development process, we focused on maintaining a cohesive architecture between the frontend and backend to ensure seamless functionality.

## Challenges

One of the primary challenges we encountered was integrating the Google Maps API with our React frontend. Additionally, fetching and displaying data from the backend in a visually appealing manner posed difficulties. Implementing artificial intelligence features also required overcoming technical hurdles and ensuring smooth integration with the existing system.
